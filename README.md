Bike Sales Excel Dashboard
Welcome to the Bike Sales Excel Dashboard repository. In this project, I have cleaned, formatted, and visualized the Bike Sales Dataset using Microsoft Excel. The dataset includes columns such as customer income, marital status, education, occupation, etc. and covers the sales data of bikes over a period of one year.

This Excel Dashboard is designed to provide insights into the bike sales data through interactive pivot tables and charts. The project includes three pivot tables that visualize the data based on marital status, region, and education.

Pivot Table Visualizations
Avg Income Per Purchase by Marital Status: This pivot table provides insights into the average income per purchase by different marital status categories.

Customer Age Bracket by Region: This pivot table shows the age brackets of customers based on the regions where they made their purchases.

Customer Commute by Education: This pivot table visualizes the commute distances of customers based on their education levels.
